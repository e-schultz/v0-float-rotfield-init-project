                <strong>Rot isn't a queue.</strong> It's a biome. You don't pick "the right log." You listen for where
                the life is starting to move.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>You aren't promoting an old note.</strong> You are harvesting from the field, pulling threads
                from the rot, from the living hum of what has composted.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>The anxiety comes from invisible pressure</strong> of systems that expect every capture to
                become a "clean note" and every fragment to "promote" neatly into a final artifact.
              </p>

                <strong>In Rotfield:</strong> Logs aren't waiting to be "promoted." Bones aren't "drafts" hoping to be
                cleaned up. They are themselves: raw material, compost, underground hum.
